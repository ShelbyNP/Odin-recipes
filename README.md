# Odin-recipes

<p><h1>Odin Project 1: Recipes</h1>
    <p>This is my first official project for the Odin Project.
    <p>The intent of this project is to practice using HTML to create a webpage with several recipes in different files. 
    <p>The following recipes will be hosted on the site:
    <ul>
        <li>Asian Chicken Wraps</li>
        <li>Enchiladas</li>
        <li>Japanese Curry</li>
    </ul>

<p><h2>What was easy?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Basic HTML from memory</li>
        <li>Adding in and resizing photos</li>
        <li>Changing background color</li>
    </ul>

<p><h2>Challenges</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Creating links back to index from each recipe page, had to use navlist to get it to work</li>
        <li>Keeping the code clean and consistant with breaks/tabs</li>
        <li>Some git hiccups </li>
