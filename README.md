# Odin-recipes

<p>This is my first official project for the Odin Project.
<p>The intent of this project is to practice using HTML to create a webpage with several recipes in different files. 
<p>The following recipes will be hosted on the site:
<ul>
    <li>Asian Chicken Wraps</li>
    <li>Enchiladas</li>
    <li>Japanese Curry </li>
